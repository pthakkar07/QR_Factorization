# QR_Factorization
Write a program to implement the recursive Strassen's matrix multiplication algorithm in Java. Instantiate a matrix as an object. Use this matrix multiplication routine to find Eigen values of a matrix by using the QR factorization based method.

Concepts that I have used:- 
1) Strassen matrix Recursive algorithm.
# A = QR
2) Finding Q using Gramâ€“Schmidt algorithm (Refer Professor Gilbertz Strang Linear Algebra Course from MIT for concept).
3) Here Matrix A size is n*n where n is power of 2 and strassen matrix work best for power of 2 size matrix.
